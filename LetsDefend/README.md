# SOC Investigation Portfolio

## Overview
Collection of Security Operations Center (SOC) investigations completed through LetsDefend training platform. Each investigation demonstrates practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and security analysis.

## Investigation Approach
All investigations follow a structured methodology:
1. **Alert Triage** - Initial assessment and prioritization
2. **Evidence Collection** - Log analysis, threat intelligence gathering
3. **Technical Analysis** - Malware analysis, IOC extraction, attack chain reconstruction
4. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** - Techniques and tactics identification
5. **Containment & Response** - Remediation recommendations and lessons learned

## Skills Demonstrated

**Threat Intelligence:**
- VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, AbuseIPDB
- OSINT techniques
- IOC extraction and correlation
- Malware family identification

**Incident Response:**
- Alert triage and prioritization
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Attack chain reconstruction
- Containment procedures
- Remediation recommendations

**Technical Analysis:**
- Malware behavior analysis
- Log analysis and correlation
- Network traffic analysis
- Email header analysis
- Web attack pattern recognition

**Documentation:**
- MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping
- Technical report writing
- IOC documentation
- Investigation methodology

## Tools & Platforms
- **SIEM/Analysis:** LetsDefend platform, log management tools
- **Threat Intel:** VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, AbuseIPDB, AnyRun
- **Frameworks:** MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain
- **Documentation:** Markdown, technical report writing

## Learning Outcomes
Through these investigations, I've developed:
- Systematic approach to alert investigation
- Ability to distinguish true positives from false positives
- Proficiency in threat intelligence gathering and correlation
- Understanding of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Professional documentation and communication skills

***Note:** All investigations are based on training scenarios using sanitized/simulated data. Real-world investigations would follow organizational procedures and chain of custody requirements.*
