### Incident Management Systems (IMS)

- Essentially a case management platform.
- Data can be directly connected to a SIEM or other security product.
	- From here, tickets/cases can be created on the IMS.
- There are security tools called Playbooks that give a method/approach to how to investigate based on the type of alert made.
	- Playbooks are very effective in ensuring that the analysis provided is consistent and thorough.
	- It is essentially a guide.
